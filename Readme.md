# Geosight

## Overview
Geosight is an innovative Python project designed by Abdullah Ghifari - Data Scientist at Telkomsel to develop a custom grid system for geospatial data. It aims to facilitate the extraction of insightful information from geospatial datasets, allowing for more effective data analysis and visualization in geographical contexts.

## Features
- **Custom Grid Creation**: Allows users to create a custom grid with or without an initial hash, tailored to specific geospatial data needs.
- **Custom Grid Decoding**: Provides functionality to decode the custom grid.
- **WKT Polygon Creation**: Enables the creation of polygons in Well-Known Text (WKT) format, useful for geospatial data representations.
- **Surrounding Grid Creation**: Offers tools to identify other grid surrounding the particular grids.

## Installation
pip install geosight

## Usage

### Without Initial Hash
Initial point generated by the furthest left location in Indonesia.

**Code**
```python3
get_custom_grid(latitude,longitude,grid_size = 1000)
```

**Output**
```
'1000_-687_1320'
```

### With Initial Hash

**Code**
```python3
get_custom_grid(latitude,longitude,grid_size = 1000,initial_hash='qqguygv1tp6t3q6')
```

**Output**
```
'qqguygv1tp6t3q6_1000_-1_0'
```
